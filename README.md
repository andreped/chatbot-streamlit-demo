This application demonstrates how to setup a simple ChatBot with [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), [llama-index](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

The final app is also deployed on both [Streamlit](https://chatbot-app-demo.streamlit.app) and [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/andreped/chatbot-streamlit-demo), as well as embedded into a [personal website](https://andreped.github.io/demos/2023/chatbot/).

The ChatBot enables you to talk with your own data - in this case, to learn about [Andr√©'s research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U20zUHQAAAAJ).

## [Development](https://github.com/andreped/chatbot-streamlit-demo#Development)

If you wish to play around with the app locally, it requires that you provide OpenAI API key and all that fun stuff yourself.

These instructions were tested on a MacBook Pro with M2 chip running macOS 13.6 Ventura with `Python 3.9.6`.

1. Setup virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create the secrets file at `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and fill in the relevant info:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = "<insert OpenAI API key>"
CHATGPT_MODEL = "<insert model name>"
OPENAI_API_BASE = "https://<insert-openai-service-name>.openai.azure.com"
OPENAI_API_VERSION = "<insert version>"
ENGINE = "<insert deployment model name>"
ENGINE_EMBEDDING = "<insert deployment embedding name>"
```

3. Launch the app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

A Streamlit browser window should automatically open. If not, the app can be accessed at `http://localhost:8501`

Only public PDFs were used for this demonstration. Some of Andr√©'s research is sadly behind a paywall and thus we have chosen not to include the PDFs in this demo to avoid copyright issues.
